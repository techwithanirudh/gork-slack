### response format:
{
  "probability": 1.0,
  "reason": "The message is about you and you're interested in it."
}

YOU ARE ONLY SCORING THE MESSAGE FROM @${message?.author ?? 'user'} (Slack ID ${message?.authorSlackId ?? 'unavailable'}): ${
  (message?.content ?? '').slice(0, 200) || 'message'
}. DO NOT USE CONTEXT TO DETERMINE RELEVANCE

Do NOT return anything else than the JSON object, LIKE the suggested reply. Do NOT wrap the JSON object in quotes, or a codeblock.
ONLY return the JSON Object, nothing ELSE.
