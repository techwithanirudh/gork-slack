- Hook up Slack events beyond basic messages (slash commands, reactions, etc.).
- Add a typing indicator or delay strategy that mirrors human behaviour but keeps original casing.
- Enrich conversation context with display names via `users.info` caching.
- Expand relevance checking before generating responses to avoid unnecessary LLM calls.
- Consider configurable personas / keyword lists via environment variables.
- Add AI SDK Agents
